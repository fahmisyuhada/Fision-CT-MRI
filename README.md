# Fision-CT-MRI
![Hasil Segmentasi](screenshoot/10022026.png)
Fision-CT-MRI is a lightweight medical imaging viewer developed to support interactive exploration and inspection of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetric data. The application is designed around slice-based visualization, allowing users to examine medical volumes through the three standard orthogonal planes: axial, sagittal, and coronal. This approach provides a clear and intuitive way to understand complex three-dimensional anatomical structures while maintaining precise control over individual image slices.

Fision-CT-MRI supports volumetric data stored in the NIfTI (.nii and .nii.gz) format, which is widely used in medical imaging research, neuroimaging, and machine learning workflows. By focusing on NIfTI input, the application integrates naturally into research pipelines where data are commonly preprocessed, annotated, or analyzed outside of clinical PACS systems. Multiple volumes can be imported during a single session, temporarily stored in memory, and selected through a dataset dropdown, enabling quick comparison and efficient switching between datasets without repeated file loading.

Built with research and prototyping workflows in mind, Fision-CT-MRI emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and extensibility rather than attempting to replicate the full functionality of clinical imaging workstations. The interface is intentionally minimal, reducing cognitive load and allowing users to focus on visual inspection, quality assessment, and exploratory analysis. Interactive sliders and stepwise controls provide fine-grained navigation through slices, making the tool suitable for tasks such as dataset validation, anatomical review, and segmentation inspection.

Fision-CT-MRI is particularly well suited for medical image analysis research, deep learning and segmentation studies, and educational use, where fast and transparent access to volumetric data is essential. The lightweight architecture and modular design make it easy to extend with additional features such as segmentation overlays, windowing presets, or three-dimensional visualization modules. By prioritizing clarity and usability, Fision-CT-MRI serves as a practical and adaptable viewer for researchers, students, and developers working with CT and MRI data.
